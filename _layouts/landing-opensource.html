                                Vendor lock-in can cost a lot, not just in cash but also in hours.
                                With Kimai, you can host it yourself, have me host it for you, or fork it and change it.
                                You're never locked into a hosted product, and all of your data is easy to export so that if you ever decide Kimai isn't for you anymore, your data is still yours (the same applies to the paid plans, I offer data export upon cancellation).

                                With closed source software, you have only the vendor's claims that they're keeping the software secure and adhering to standards.
                                The visibility of the code behind open source software means you can see for yourself.
                                You can always see my responses to the community, the release schedule and milestones, and every commit and pull request review.
